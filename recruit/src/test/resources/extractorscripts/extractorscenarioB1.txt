I'm on the look out for a UK based junior or midweight Python Developer for a Digital Publishing start up? Please feel free to pass on my details or vice versa if you know anyone suitable. 
 
It's being offered on a fully remote basis, as long as the person lives in the UK. Python is key, but any Supabase experience would put the person to the top of the list. It's a great opportunity to join at the beginning of the company's journey; this would be the first full time hire.

Message me direct for full job spec and salary.

Hi Network!

I'm looking for an expert Angular Developer to join a world leading commodities company in London, paying up to Â£850pd outside of IR35.

You must have experience with NgRX, C#, AG Grid, and ideally the latest versions of Angular, and coming from a Trading or Commodities environment would be a plus!

This is an urgent request, if you or anyone you know may be interested, please reach out to me ASAP.

Iâ€™m currently looking to connect with DevOps Engineers / SREs interested in a new opportunity in Dublin.

The role focuses on:
 ðŸ”¹ Driving automation to reduce manual effort and improve service reliability
 ðŸ”¹ Enhancing monitoring, observability, and alerting across systems
 ðŸ”¹ Building APIs, integrations, and infrastructure-as-code
 ðŸ”¹ Supporting cloud platforms (AWS / Azure) and performance tuning
 ðŸ”¹ Contributing to a strong DevOps / SRE culture and mentoring teammates

Itâ€™s a hybrid Dublin-based role with a strong emphasis on automation, observability, and scalability.

Would you be open to a chat to see if this could be a good fit for you (or someone in your network)?
